      <h1>About Starlight Kids Theater Co.</h1>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Starlight Kids Theater Co. was founded by a group of teachers, parents, and theater professionals who wanted to create a welcoming space for young performers. What started as one weekend workshop has grown into a full-season program of classes, camps, and productions.</p>
        <p>We believe that theater should be accessible to every child, regardless of experience level or background. Scholarships, mentorship, and community partnerships help us keep our doors open to as many families as possible.</p>

      <section class="section-card">
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>Everything we do is guided by three core values: creativity, collaboration, and courage. We celebrate unique voices, encourage kind teamwork, and support students as they take brave steps onstage and off.</p>
        <p>From the first rehearsal to final curtain call, our staff focuses on creating a positive, safe environment where students can grow as artists and as people.</p>

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <p>Our programs are designed for students in elementary, middle, and high school. Some of our performers dream of Broadway; others just want to try something new. We are proud to welcome a wide range of personalities, talents, and experience levels into our casts and crews.</p>
